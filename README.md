Files and scripts needed to replicate all biased and unbiased simulations and analyses in (insert DOI when possible). Simulations were run with GROMACS and utilize PACKMOL to generate inputs and PLUMED to restrain coordinates. Analysis scripts require the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and MDAnalysis libraries.

## sim
Contains folder with PACKMOL input scripts and all PDB files of individual components, as well as representative gro input structures. Also contains folder with GROMACS mdp files and representative PLUMED dat files. 

## analysis
Scripts required to reproduce all analysis performed in both the manuscript and supplemental information.
